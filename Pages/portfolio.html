            <h2>Migrating Monolith Application to Microservices Architecture</h2>
            <p>I was responsible for migrating a Monolithic Application to 13 Microservices for my organization. To achieve this, I implemented microservices design patterns, namely the Service Discovery Pattern and the API Gateway Pattern. For Service Discovery, the application used a Eureka Server. The API Gateway was developed using Spring Cloud Gateway framework, which helped in managing external API calls. I also ensured Error Handling was implemented in the API Gateway. Finally, for non-blocking API calls, the API Gateway used Spring WebFlux. I achieved high scalability and lowered latency in API calls by 67%.</p>

            <h2>Todo Application with Notification System</h2>
            <p>The project employed a microservices architecture having components such as API Gateway and Eureka Server and 2 Microservices. Users can create labels for lists such as Grocery, Today, Travel, etc. and add items to them using Factory Pattern. 
                I was responsible for the Priority Module using which Users can set Priority to an item such as High, Low, Medium, Special dynamically using Decorator Pattern, and Creating API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway and Eureka Server using Spring Cloud Netflix Library. Users get notified on email on due date and on todo completion using Observer Pattern. Application had User Authentication implemented using JWT token. Demonstrated Multiple Design Patterns such as Observer, Decorator, Command. Developed an Azure DevOps CI pipeline. Added Unit Testing using JUnit. Developed this team project for the Module CS5721 - Software Design. Learnt important skills such as conceptualising, designing, developing, testing, and deploying a software application written in Java 11 and Spring Boot. Learnt effective teamwork and collaboration from this project.</p>
