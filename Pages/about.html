            <p>Ever since high school, I have been interested in coding. In class 9, I learned HTML and designed a website, as a school project on the Effects of Global Warming. In class 12, I learned C++ in school and learned about Object-oriented programming. I loved how logic along with creativity in computer programs have made life more comfortable and brought an enormous advancement in technology. It became clear to me that I will one day build my career in the fascinating field of computers, and that determination is within me to this present day.</p>

            <p>My nature has always inclined me toward planning ahead; it's how I’ve functioned from the start. During my time in high school, I started making an active effort to pursue my dream of studying at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - one of the most prestigious technical institutes in the world. I dedicated three years of meticulous study and unwavering hard work, and it paid off. I secured an All India Rank (AIR) of 3245 to earn my place at IIT Madras. I gained admission to the institute primarily driven by its reputation, regardless of the specific field of study. I joined Metallurgical Engineering based on my interest in Steel-making processes. To satiate my curiosity about a computer’s fundamental functioning and my desire to become an adept software developer, I decided to take elective courses in Programming in C, Data Structures, and Algorithms, Linear Algebra, and Applied Statistics. These courses have had a profound impact on my interest and have facilitated intimate knowledge and understanding of the core workings of systems. I was drawn to mobile application development because mobile devices are easily accessible and mobile applications have an immense range of practical uses. Therefore, I decided to learn Android application development independently. I developed an interactive map application for the university to manage on-campus events. I collaborated with other talented and passionate students from various Disciplines. This was inspiring in more ways than one. To work amongst like-minded people who are from different specialisations yet passionate about software was an enriching experience. To further my knowledge and contribute back to the student community who are new to the concepts of application development, I decided to organise a workshop to teach Android Development to 800 students. It was the most attended student-organized seminar of the institute that year. This was my first experience in application development and played a significant role in shaping my interest in the same.</p>

            <p>During the course on Transportation Network Analysis, I worked on an academic group project titled ‘Developing an app for booking a ride-sharing cab’. My responsibility was to develop the algorithm to search cabs in an optimized way and check whether a rider can be accepted in an ongoing ride. My first step was to use Dijkstra's Algorithm coded in Java, to find the shortest path with the BFS approach. I read multiple research papers on cab aggregators like Uber, and Ola in India, to further optimise the search space. That’s how I learnt about dividing the area into grids and searching for rides only within a grid. The next step was the Insertion Feasibility Algorithm which used the re-routing distance and extra time for a new person to be added to be within a limit. This experience taught me about the applications of Algorithms in real life and cemented my understanding of the fundamentals of Algorithms. Working with exceptional peers, I also learned from their approach to problem-solving. This ignited in me the passion for doing research in this field and working with extraordinary minds to produce results which are fulfilling.</p>

            <p>To pursue my dream of becoming a Software Engineer, I took the opportunity to intern at Citigroup, India. I was responsible for the development of a crucial part of Citigroup’s Foreign Exchange Local Markets division, in the most extensively used trade-booking system in the Division globally. I played a key role in solving a production issue. It was the responsibility of Citigroup to settle fees and send handoff files to the regulators’ servers at midnight every day, and because of stuck records, they couldn’t do it in time. It took more than a couple of hours to fix the problem every time. I developed a solution. The stuck database records were selected and moved to a different table. I created a web application for this purpose employing DataTables API (a Table plug-in for jQuery), Struts 2.0, and JSP. First, the maker has to submit a request. Another checker has to approve the maker's request. The issue was resolved in a few minutes, thus achieving a huge 94.4% reduction in time utilized. This gave me immense learning as I used theoretical knowledge of software development to build an application for the real world. I decided to join the industry after being offered a permanent position.</p>

            <p>My last professional milestone was a Senior Software Developer role at Rosmerta Technologies Limited, India. I was part of the Vehicle Tracking Solutions (VTS) Vertical. The VTS Team handles many applications that manage data transmitted from GPS tracking devices installed in vehicles, buses, or trucks, depending on the use case. In this role, I have focused on code quality and writing clean, and modular code. I have mentored Junior Developers, offering guidance on Java and Spring Framework-related issues. I have worked on building the backend of real-time applications and building optimised Restful APIs. I have built APIs for returning data, searching and filtering data. Another major experience in API development is that I developed an API for sending batch emails based on the user’s alert configuration. Alerts can be configured to send on particular days of the week, monthly, or yearly. The type of alerts can be chosen at the time of setting configuration. I used Spring JavaMailSender to send emails, running concurrently with a maximum of three threads in parallel. This was done to meet the throttling limit on the Microsoft SMTP server which allows only up to three concurrent connections.</p>
