                    <h2>University of Limerick, IIT Graduate</h2>
                    <p>Ever since high school, I have been interested in coding. In class 9, I learned HTML and designed a website, as a school project on the Effects of Global Warming. In class 12, I learned C++ in school and learned about Object-oriented programming. I loved how logic along with creativity in computer programs have made life more comfortable and brought an enormous advancement in technology. It became clear to me that I will one day build my career in the fascinating field of computers, and that determination is within me to this present day.</p>
                    <p>My nature has always inclined me toward planning ahead; it's how I've functioned from the start. During my time in high school, I started making an active effort to pursue my dream of studying at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - one of the most prestigious technical institutes in the world. I dedicated three years of meticulous study and unwavering hard work, and it paid off. I secured an All India Rank (AIR) of 3245 to earn my place at IIT Madras. To satiate my curiosity about a computer's fundamental functioning and my desire to become an adept software developer, I decided to take elective courses in Programming in C, Data Structures, and Algorithms, Linear Algebra, and Applied Statistics. These courses have had a profound impact on my interest and have facilitated intimate knowledge and understanding of the core workings of systems.</p>   
                    <p>I was drawn to mobile application development because mobile devices are easily accessible and mobile applications have an immense range of practical uses. Therefore, I decided to learn Android application development independently. I developed an interactive map application for the university to manage on-campus events. I collaborated with other talented and passionate students from various Disciplines. To work amongst like-minded people who are from different specialisations yet passionate about software was an enriching experience.</p>   
                    <p>I am pursuing a postgraduate degree in Software Engineering and Data Analytics from the University of Limerick to get me closer to my professional goals and provide me with an opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge and expertise by developing projects in the fields of Software Design, Architecture, Quality and Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Big Data and also improve my Profile to join a Technology firm as a Mid-Senior Level Software Development Professional.</p>
