                        <p>The project employed a microservices architecture having components such as API Gateway and Eureka Server and 2 Microservices. Users can create labels for lists such as Grocery, Today, Travel, etc. and add items to them using Factory Pattern. 
                            I was responsible for the Priority Module using which Users can set Priority to an item such as High, Low, Medium, Special dynamically using Decorator Pattern, and Creating API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway and Eureka Server using Spring Cloud Netflix Library. Users get notified on email on due date and on todo completion using Observer Pattern. Application had User Authentication implemented using JWT token. Demonstrated Multiple Design Patterns such as Observer, Decorator, Command. Developed an Azure DevOps CI pipeline. Added Unit Testing using JUnit. Developed this team project for the Module CS5721 - Software Design. Learnt important skills such as conceptualising, designing, developing, testing, and deploying a software application written in Java 11 and Spring Boot. Learnt effective teamwork and collaboration from this project.</p>

                <div class = "project_description">
                    <p>I was responsible for migrating a Monolithic Application to 13 Microservices for my organization. To achieve this, I implemented microservices design patterns, namely the Service Discovery Pattern and the API Gateway Pattern. For Service Discovery, the application used a Eureka Server. The API Gateway was developed using Spring Cloud Gateway framework, which helped in managing external API calls. I also ensured Error Handling was implemented in the API Gateway. Finally, for non-blocking API calls, the API Gateway used Spring WebFlux. I achieved high scalability and lowered latency in API calls by 67%.</p>

            <div class = "project_two_columns">
                <div class = "project_description">
                    <p>Course Project for CS6502 - Applied Big Data and Visualization. Credit card fraud is a pervasive issue, escalating in frequency over recent years. Our project endeavours to combat this menace by harnessing the power of big data analytics and machine learning. By scrutinizing transactional data and employing advanced algorithms, we aim to unearth patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent activity in real time. Through this initiative, we aspire to fortify the security of financial transactions and curtail the proliferation of fraudulent practices. The output from our Project would be predicting whether a transaction is fraudulent or not fraudulent, based on the historical data which is used to train the machine learning models.</p>
                    <p>We utilized PySpark within Jupyter Notebooks. By harnessing the power of in-memory processing, distributed computing, fault tolerance, and advanced analytics, we aimed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection. Our projectâ€™s goal is to safeguard financial institutions and consumers against malicious activities.</p>

                <div class = "project_description">
                    <p>The project delved into the nuances of energy consumption in the steel industry, leveraging Python and Jupyter Notebook for analysis. Beginning with thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project unveiled insights into statistical summaries, distribution patterns, correlations, and temporal trends within the dataset. Subsequent data preparation involved a meticulous process of cleaning, formatting, imputation, and transformation to ensure data integrity and usability. Clustering techniques were then applied to identify inherent patterns and groupings within the data, shedding light on potential energy consumption profiles. Classification tasks were undertaken to classify and predict energy consumption behaviour using a variety of classifiers, facilitating a deeper understanding of the dataset's characteristics. Lastly, regression analysis was employed to model and predict energy consumption trends, providing actionable insights for optimizing energy usage and promoting sustainability in the steel industry. Through this multifaceted approach, the project aimed to unlock valuable insights critical for informed decision-making and operational efficiency improvements.</p>
