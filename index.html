                <h2>Profile Summary</h2>
                <p>I am a Master's Student in Software Engineering and Data Analytics at University of Limerick. I have a demonstrated history of leveraging innovative engineering methodologies to drive organizational success.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Ever since high school, I have been interested in coding. In class 9, I learned HTML and designed a website, as a school project on the Effects of Global Warming. In class 12, I learned C++ in school and learned about Object-oriented programming. I loved how logic along with creativity in computer programs have made life more comfortable and brought an enormous advancement in technology. It became clear to me that I will one day build my career in the fascinating field of computers, and that determination is within me to this present day.</p>
                <p>My nature has always inclined me toward planning ahead; it's how I've functioned from the start. During my time in high school, I started making an active effort to pursue my dream of studying at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - one of the most prestigious technical institutes in the world. I dedicated three years of meticulous study and unwavering hard work, and it paid off. I secured an All India Rank (AIR) of 3245 to earn my place at IIT Madras. To satiate my curiosity about a computer's fundamental functioning and my desire to become an adept software developer, I decided to take elective courses in Programming in C, Data Structures, and Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Biological Data Analytics, and Applied Statistics. These courses have had a profound impact on my interest and have facilitated intimate knowledge and understanding of the core workings of systems.</p>   
                <p>I was drawn to mobile application development because mobile devices are easily accessible and mobile applications have an immense range of practical uses. Therefore, I decided to learn Android application development independently. I developed an interactive map application for the university to manage on-campus events. I collaborated with other talented and passionate students from various Disciplines. To work amongst like-minded people who are from different specialisations yet passionate about software was an enriching experience.</p>   
                <p>I am pursuing a postgraduate degree in Software Engineering and Data Analytics from the University of Limerick to get me closer to my professional goals and provide me with an opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge and expertise by developing projects in the fields of Software Design, Architecture, Quality and Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Big Data and also improve my Profile to join a Technology firm as a Mid-Senior Level Software Development Professional.</p>

                        <p>I was responsible for migrating a Monolithic Application to 13 Microservices for my organization. To achieve this, I implemented microservices design patterns, namely the Service Discovery Pattern and the API Gateway Pattern. For Service Discovery, the application used a Eureka Server. The API Gateway was developed using Spring Cloud Gateway framework, which helped in managing external API calls. I also ensured Error Handling was implemented in the API Gateway. Finally, for non-blocking API calls, the API Gateway used Spring WebFlux. I achieved high scalability and lowered latency in API calls by 67%.</p>

                        <p>Course Project for CS6502 - Applied Big Data and Visualization. Credit card fraud is a pervasive issue, escalating in frequency over recent years. Our project endeavours to combat this menace by harnessing the power of big data analytics and machine learning. By scrutinizing transactional data and employing advanced algorithms, we aim to unearth patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent activity in real time. Through this initiative, we aspire to fortify the security of financial transactions and curtail the proliferation of fraudulent practices. The output from our Project would be predicting whether a transaction is fraudulent or not fraudulent, based on the historical data which is used to train the machine learning models.</p>
                        <p>We utilized PySpark within Jupyter Notebooks. By harnessing the power of in-memory processing, distributed computing, fault tolerance, and advanced analytics, we aimed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection. Our project’s goal is to safeguard financial institutions and consumers against malicious activities.</p>

                        <p>The project delved into the nuances of energy consumption in the steel industry, leveraging Python and Jupyter Notebook for analysis. Beginning with thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project unveiled insights into statistical summaries, distribution patterns, correlations, and temporal trends within the dataset. Subsequent data preparation involved a meticulous process of cleaning, formatting, imputation, and transformation to ensure data integrity and usability. Clustering techniques were then applied to identify inherent patterns and groupings within the data, shedding light on potential energy consumption profiles. Classification tasks were undertaken to classify and predict energy consumption behaviour using a variety of classifiers, facilitating a deeper understanding of the dataset's characteristics. Lastly, regression analysis was employed to model and predict energy consumption trends, providing actionable insights for optimizing energy usage and promoting sustainability in the steel industry. Through this multifaceted approach, the project aimed to unlock valuable insights critical for informed decision-making and operational efficiency improvements.</p>
